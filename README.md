# 🏎️ Automotive Hub

**Automotive Hub** is a responsive, single-page application (SPA) designed to simulate a high-end car dealership. It moves away from clunky, traditional designs and embraces a "dark mode" aesthetic with gold accents, focusing on visual hierarchy and user experience.

Unlike typical static sites, this project features a **client-side order system** that generates digital receipts without needing a backend database.
